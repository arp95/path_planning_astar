### Introduction to the Project
In this project, the A-star motion planning algorithm was used on a point robot and rigid robot to navigate in a configuration space consisting of static obstacles.


### Results

### Software Required
To run the .py files, use Python 3. Standard Python 3 libraries like numpy, heapq and OpenCV are used.


### Instructions for running the code
To run the code for finding the path, follow the following commands:

```
cd Code
python astar.py
```
